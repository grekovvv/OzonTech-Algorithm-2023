# OzonTech-Algorithm-2023

Its repository when you can find all tasks from ozon tech contest (route256) 5'th February 2023. 

It's so comfortable for you, my friend. In one place I collect all what you need:
1. Automatization system for test your solution.
2. All tests.
3. Task Sandbox\Contest in PDF.

If you have solution for any task - just pull request. It's simple. So we will have solution for all tasks in one place.

I take care just about tasks in Sandbox. It take more time than I expected, so I was stop on this part and go do other matters.

Good Luck in your adventures!

P.S. I don't know work this links for all people, but I leave it here.
